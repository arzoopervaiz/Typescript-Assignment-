// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
// Define the function to store information about a car
function createCar(manufacturer, model, optional) {
    return Object.assign({ manufacturer,
        model }, optional);
}
// Call the function with required information
const carInfo = createCar("Toyota", "Corolla", { color: "White", year: "2024," });
// Print the Object returned by the function
console.log(carInfo);
