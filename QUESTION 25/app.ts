// 25.Alien Colors #1: Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'.
// • Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message that the player just earned 5 points.
// • Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The version that fails will have no output.)
 // Variable to store the color of the alien
let alien_color:string=' green'

// Version that passes the if test
if('alien_color==green')// Check if the alien's color is green
{
    console.log('the player just earned 5 points')// If true, print a message

}

// Version that fails the if test (no output)
     else
     {
   

}
