// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code should look something like this:
// let car = 'subaru';
// console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")// console.log(car == 'subaru')
// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to Fals

let five:number = 5;
let ten :number = 10;


//make true condition
//test conditon 1 :
console.log ("Test 1 : five is equal to five");
console.log(five==5);

//test condition 2:
console.log("Test 2: ten is equal to ten");
console.log(ten==10);

//test condition 3:
console.log("Test 3: ten is greater than five")
console.log(ten>5);

//test condition 4:
console.log("test 4: five is less than ten");
console.log(five<10)

//test condition 5:
console.log("test 5: ten is not equal to five");
console.log(ten!=5);

//make false condition.

//test condition 1:
console.log("test 1:five is equal to ten ")
console.log(five==10);

//test condition 2:
console.log("test 2: ten is equal to five")
console.log(ten==5);

//test condition 3:
console.log("test 3: five is not equal to five");
console.log(five !==5);

//test condition 4:
console.log ("ten is less than equal to five");
console.log(ten<=5);

//test condition 5:
console.log("five is greater than equal to ten");
console.log(five>=10);
